## *COURSES* ##

*New for Spring 2021 at CWRU!*

  + **Coding for the Humanities: Python, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning (HUMN 305/405).** An entry-level, humanities-oriented introduction to coding, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning for undergraduate and graduate students. Course objectives include: (1) gaining hands-on mastery of fundamental coding skills in Python (a powerful and highly readable programming language that is the lingua franca of NLP and machine learning); (2) individual and collaborative lab projects that develop skills in problem-solving and program design; and (3) sustained critical reflection from humanities perspectives about the tools and processes with which we are experimenting. The course will be of value for students who are developing and designing research projects as well as for those entering professional contexts in which basic coding skills are advantageous.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Appropriate to its content, this is a hybrid course, involving, on the one hand, instructor-supervised individual and collaborative work via online tools such as Canvas, Colab, GitHub, and Slack, and, on the other hand, day-long intensive face-to- face sessions, led by the instructor, to share work in progress and facilitate critical reflection and theorizing about that work. Evaluation based on mastery of basic Python, an individual coding project, and a collaborative group coding project.

## *DIY TUTORIALS* ##

  + **[Build a Bot.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18f0pvnrb7I7IAYu1soWRBi4RiwLbW5Iy?usp=sharing)** This Google Colab notebook offers easy-to-follow directions to make your own fully functional text bot. Based on the code for KJVBot, it auto-generates its own verses based on the King James Version Bible. It is easily adaptable to other texts. No coding experience is necessary here, but each step is annotated for those who want to understand more about what's going on from line to line.
